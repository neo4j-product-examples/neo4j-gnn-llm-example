They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face. Melanomas can also occur in areas that don\\'t receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole, The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin, Melanoma doesn\\'t always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles, Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They\\'re oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma, To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch . E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas, Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn\\'t think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it\\'s more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It\\'s more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye . An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Melanoma occurs when something goes wrong in the melanin-producing cells that give color to your skin. Normally, skin cells develop in a controlled and orderly way — healthy new cells push older cells toward your skin\\'s surface, where they die and eventually fall off. But when some cells develop DNA damage, new cells may begin to grow out of control and can eventually form a mass of cancerous cells. Just what damages DNA in skin cells and how this leads to melanoma isn\\'t clear. It\\'s likely that a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors, causes melanoma. Still, doctors believe exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds is the leading cause of melanoma. UV light doesn\\'t cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don\\'t receive exposure to sunlight. This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"Factors that may increase your risk of melanoma include: Fair skin. Having less pigment in your skin means you have less protection from damaging UV radiation. If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you\\'re more likely to develop melanoma than is someone with a darker complexion. But melanoma can develop in people with darker complexions, including Hispanic people and black people. A history of sunburn. One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma. Excessive ultraviolet light exposure. Exposure to UV radiation, which comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds, can increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation. People living closer to the earth\\'s equator, where the sun\\'s rays are more direct, experience higher amounts of UV radiation than do those living farther north or south. In addition, if you live at a high elevation, you\\'re exposed to more UV radiation. Having many moles or unusual moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Also, having an unusual type of mole increases the risk of melanoma. Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these tend to be larger than normal moles and have irregular borders and a mixture of colors. A family history of melanoma. If a close relative — such as a parent, child or sibling — has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too. Weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Your immune system may be impaired if you take medicine to suppress the immune system, such as after an organ transplant, or if you have a disease that impairs the immune system, such as AIDS.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. For many people in North America, the sun\\'s rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy. You absorb UV radiation year-round, and clouds offer little protection from damaging rays. Avoiding the sun at its strongest helps you avoid the sunburns and suntans that cause skin damage and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Sun exposure accumulated over time also may cause skin cancer., Wear sunscreen year-round. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you\\'re swimming or perspiring., Wear protective clothing. Cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or visor. Some companies also sell protective clothing. A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand. Don\\'t forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of UV radiation — UVA and UVB rays., Avoid tanning lamps and beds. Tanning lamps and beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer., Become familiar with your skin so that you\\'ll notice changes. Examine your skin often for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Examine your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Examine both the front and back of your legs and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks.\", \\'mayo_see_doc\\': \\'When to see a doctor, Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any skin changes that seem unusual.\\'}}'},\n",

Morphologically, it is characterized by the presence of cords of basaloid cells extending from the epidermis into the dermis, creating a fenestrating pattern. It follows an indolent course.\\', \\'mayo_symptoms\\': \"Basal cell carcinoma usually develops on sun-exposed parts of your body, especially your head and neck. Less often, basal cell carcinoma can develop on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the genitals. Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won\\'t heal. These changes in the skin usually have one of the following characteristics: A pearly white, skin-colored or pink bump that is translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface. Tiny blood vessels are often visible. In people with darker skin tones, the lesion may be darker but still somewhat translucent. The most common type of basal cell carcinoma, this lesion often appears on the face and ears. The lesion may rupture, bleed and scab over. A brown, black or blue lesion — or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised, translucent border. A flat, scaly, reddish patch with a raised edge is more common on the back or chest. Over time, these patches can grow quite large. A white, waxy, scar-like lesion without a clearly defined border, called morpheaform basal cell carcinoma, is the least common.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Basal cell carcinoma occurs when one of the skin\\'s basal cells develops a mutation in its DNA. Basal cells are found at the bottom of the epidermis — the outermost layer of skin. Basal cells produce new skin cells. As new skin cells are produced, they push older cells toward the skin\\'s surface, where the old cells die and are sloughed off. The process of creating new skin cells is controlled by a basal cell\\'s DNA. The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutation tells the basal cell to multiply rapidly and continue growing when it would normally die. Eventually the accumulating abnormal cells may form a cancerous tumor — the lesion that appears on the skin. Ultraviolet light and other causes, Much of the damage to DNA in basal cells is thought to result from ultraviolet radiation found in sunlight and in commercial tanning lamps and tanning beds.

Radiation therapy to treat acne or other skin conditions may increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma at previous treatment sites on the skin. Fair skin. The risk of basal cell carcinoma is higher among people who freckle or burn easily or who have very light skin, red or blond hair, or light-colored eyes. Increasing age. Because basal cell carcinoma often takes decades to develop, the majority of basal cell carcinomas occur in older adults. But it can also affect younger adults and is becoming more common in people in their 20s and 30s. A personal or family history of skin cancer. If you\\'ve had basal cell carcinoma one or more times, you have a good chance of developing it again. If you have a family history of skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of developing basal cell carcinoma. Immune-suppressing drugs. Taking medications that suppress your immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs used after transplant surgery, significantly increases your risk of skin cancer. Exposure to arsenic. Arsenic, a toxic metal that\\'s found widely in the environment, increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma and other cancers. Everyone has some arsenic exposure because it occurs naturally. But some people may have higher exposure if they drink contaminated well water or have a job that involves producing or using arsenic. Inherited syndromes that cause skin cancer.

They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face. Melanomas can also occur in areas that don\\'t receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole, The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin, Melanoma doesn\\'t always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles, Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They\\'re oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma, To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch . E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas, Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn\\'t think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it\\'s more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It\\'s more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye . An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Melanoma occurs when something goes wrong in the melanin-producing cells that give color to your skin. Normally, skin cells develop in a controlled and orderly way — healthy new cells push older cells toward your skin\\'s surface, where they die and eventually fall off. But when some cells develop DNA damage, new cells may begin to grow out of control and can eventually form a mass of cancerous cells. Just what damages DNA in skin cells and how this leads to melanoma isn\\'t clear. It\\'s likely that a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors, causes melanoma. Still, doctors believe exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds is the leading cause of melanoma. UV light doesn\\'t cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don\\'t receive exposure to sunlight. This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"Factors that may increase your risk of melanoma include: Fair skin. Having less pigment in your skin means you have less protection from damaging UV radiation. If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you\\'re more likely to develop melanoma than is someone with a darker complexion. But melanoma can develop in people with darker complexions, including Hispanic people and black people. A history of sunburn. One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma. Excessive ultraviolet light exposure. Exposure to UV radiation, which comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds, can increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation. People living closer to the earth\\'s equator, where the sun\\'s rays are more direct, experience higher amounts of UV radiation than do those living farther north or south. In addition, if you live at a high elevation, you\\'re exposed to more UV radiation. Having many moles or unusual moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Also, having an unusual type of mole increases the risk of melanoma. Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these tend to be larger than normal moles and have irregular borders and a mixture of colors. A family history of melanoma. If a close relative — such as a parent, child or sibling — has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too. Weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Your immune system may be impaired if you take medicine to suppress the immune system, such as after an organ transplant, or if you have a disease that impairs the immune system, such as AIDS.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day.

Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won\\'t heal. These changes in the skin usually have one of the following characteristics: A pearly white, skin-colored or pink bump that is translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface. Tiny blood vessels are often visible. In people with darker skin tones, the lesion may be darker but still somewhat translucent. The most common type of basal cell carcinoma, this lesion often appears on the face and ears. The lesion may rupture, bleed and scab over. A brown, black or blue lesion — or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised, translucent border. A flat, scaly, reddish patch with a raised edge is more common on the back or chest. Over time, these patches can grow quite large. A white, waxy, scar-like lesion without a clearly defined border, called morpheaform basal cell carcinoma, is the least common.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Basal cell carcinoma occurs when one of the skin\\'s basal cells develops a mutation in its DNA. Basal cells are found at the bottom of the epidermis — the outermost layer of skin. Basal cells produce new skin cells. As new skin cells are produced, they push older cells toward the skin\\'s surface, where the old cells die and are sloughed off. The process of creating new skin cells is controlled by a basal cell\\'s DNA. The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutation tells the basal cell to multiply rapidly and continue growing when it would normally die. Eventually the accumulating abnormal cells may form a cancerous tumor — the lesion that appears on the skin. Ultraviolet light and other causes, Much of the damage to DNA in basal cells is thought to result from ultraviolet radiation found in sunlight and in commercial tanning lamps and tanning beds.

Radiation therapy to treat acne or other skin conditions may increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma at previous treatment sites on the skin. Fair skin. The risk of basal cell carcinoma is higher among people who freckle or burn easily or who have very light skin, red or blond hair, or light-colored eyes. Increasing age. Because basal cell carcinoma often takes decades to develop, the majority of basal cell carcinomas occur in older adults. But it can also affect younger adults and is becoming more common in people in their 20s and 30s. A personal or family history of skin cancer. If you\\'ve had basal cell carcinoma one or more times, you have a good chance of developing it again. If you have a family history of skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of developing basal cell carcinoma. Immune-suppressing drugs. Taking medications that suppress your immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs used after transplant surgery, significantly increases your risk of skin cancer. Exposure to arsenic. Arsenic, a toxic metal that\\'s found widely in the environment, increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma and other cancers. Everyone has some arsenic exposure because it occurs naturally. But some people may have higher exposure if they drink contaminated well water or have a job that involves producing or using arsenic. Inherited syndromes that cause skin cancer.

The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide. Errors in the instructions can cause the cell to stop its normal function and may allow a cell to become cancerous. What do gene mutations do?, A gene mutation can instruct a healthy cell to: Allow rapid growth. A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly. This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation. Fail to stop uncontrolled cell growth. Normal cells know when to stop growing so that you have just the right number of each type of cell. Cancer cells lose the controls that tell them when to stop growing. A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating. Make mistakes when repairing DNA errors. DNA repair genes look for errors in a cell\\'s DNA and make corrections. A mutation in a DNA repair gene may mean that other errors aren\\'t corrected, leading cells to become cancerous. These mutations are the most common ones found in cancer. But many other gene mutations can contribute to causing cancer. What causes gene mutations?, Gene mutations can occur for several reasons, for instance: Gene mutations you\\'re born with. You may be born with a genetic mutation that you inherited from your parents. This type of mutation accounts for a small percentage of cancers. Gene mutations that occur after birth. Most gene mutations occur after you\\'re born and aren\\'t inherited. A number of forces can cause gene mutations, such as smoking, radiation, viruses, cancer-causing chemicals, obesity, hormones, chronic inflammation and a lack of exercise. Gene mutations occur frequently during normal cell growth. However, cells contain a mechanism that recognizes when a mistake occurs and repairs the mistake. Occasionally, a mistake is missed. This could cause a cell to become cancerous. How do gene mutations interact with each other?, The gene mutations you\\'re born with and those that you acquire throughout your life work together to cause cancer. For instance, if you\\'ve inherited a genetic mutation that predisposes you to cancer, that doesn\\'t mean you\\'re certain to get cancer. Instead, you may need one or more other gene mutations to cause cancer. Your inherited gene mutation could make you more likely than other people to develop cancer when exposed to a certain cancer-causing substance. It\\'s not clear just how many mutations must accumulate for cancer to form. It\\'s likely that this varies among cancer types.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"While doctors have an idea of what may increase your risk of cancer, the majority of cancers occur in people who don\\'t have any known risk factors. Factors known to increase your risk of cancer include: Your age, Cancer can take decades to develop. That\\'s why most people diagnosed with cancer are 65 or older. While it\\'s more common in older adults, cancer isn\\'t exclusively an adult disease — cancer can be diagnosed at any age. Your habits, Certain lifestyle choices are known to increase your risk of cancer. Smoking, drinking more than one alcoholic drink a day or two drinks a day, excessive exposure to the sun or frequent blistering sunburns, being obese, and having unsafe sex can contribute to cancer. You can change these habits to lower your risk of cancer — though some habits are easier to change than others. Your family history, Only a small portion of cancers are due to an inherited condition. If cancer is common in your family, it\\'s possible that mutations are being passed from one generation to the next. You might be a candidate for genetic testing to see whether you have inherited mutations that might increase your risk of certain cancers. Keep in mind that having an inherited genetic mutation doesn\\'t necessarily mean you\\'ll get cancer. Your health conditions, Some chronic health conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, can markedly increase your risk of developing certain cancers. Talk to your doctor about your risk. Your environment, The environment around you may contain harmful chemicals that can increase your risk of cancer. Even if you don\\'t smoke, you might inhale secondhand smoke if you go where people are smoking or if you live with someone who smokes. Chemicals in your home or workplace, such as asbestos and benzene, also are associated with an increased risk of cancer.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"Cancer and its treatment can cause several complications, including: Pain. Pain can be caused by cancer or by cancer treatment, though not all cancer is painful. Medications and other approaches can effectively treat cancer-related pain. Fatigue. Fatigue in people with cancer has many causes, but it can often be managed. Fatigue associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatments is common, but it\\'s usually temporary. Difficulty breathing. Cancer or cancer treatment may cause a feeling of being short of breath. Treatments may bring relief. Nausea. Certain cancers and cancer treatments can cause nausea. Your doctor can sometimes predict if your treatment is likely to cause nausea. Medications and other treatments may help you prevent or decrease nausea. Diarrhea or constipation. Cancer and cancer treatment can affect your bowels and cause diarrhea or constipation. Weight loss. Cancer and cancer treatment may cause weight loss. Cancer steals food from normal cells and deprives them of nutrients. This is often not affected by how many calories or what kind of food is eaten; it\\'s difficult to treat. In most cases, using artificial nutrition through tubes into the stomach or vein does not help change the weight loss. Chemical changes in your body. Cancer can upset the normal chemical balance in your body and increase your risk of serious complications. Signs and symptoms of chemical imbalances might include excessive thirst, frequent urination, constipation and confusion. Brain and nervous system problems. Cancer can press on nearby nerves and cause pain and loss of function of one part of your body. Cancer that involves the brain can cause headaches and stroke-like signs and symptoms, such as weakness on one side of your body. Unusual immune system reactions to cancer. In some cases the body\\'s immune system may react to the presence of cancer by attacking healthy cells. Called paraneoplastic syndrome, these very rare reactions can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, such as difficulty walking and seizures. Cancer that spreads. As cancer advances, it may spread to other parts of the body. Where cancer spreads depends on the type of cancer. Cancer that returns. Cancer survivors have a risk of cancer recurrence. Some cancers are more likely to recur than others. Ask your doctor about what you can do to reduce your risk of cancer recurrence. Your doctor may devise a follow-up care plan for you after treatment. This plan may include periodic scans and exams in the months and years after your treatment, to look for cancer recurrence.\", \\'mayo_prevention\\': \"There\\'s no certain way to prevent cancer. But doctors have identified several ways of reducing your cancer risk, such as: Stop smoking. If you smoke, quit. If you don\\'t smoke, don\\'t start. Smoking is linked to several types of cancer — not just lung cancer. Stopping now will reduce your risk of cancer in the future. Avoid excessive sun exposure. Harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun can increase your risk of skin cancer. Limit your sun exposure by staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing or applying sunscreen. Eat a healthy diet. Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Select whole grains and lean proteins. Exercise most days of the week. Regular exercise is linked to a lower risk of cancer. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. If you haven\\'t been exercising regularly, start out slowly and work your way up to 30 minutes or longer. Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or obese may increase your risk of cancer. Work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise. Drink alcohol in moderation, if you choose to drink. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit yourself to one drink a day if you\\'re a woman of any age or a man older than age 65, or two drinks a day if you\\'re a man 65 years old or younger. Schedule cancer screening exams. Talk to your doctor about what types of cancer screening exams are best for you based on your risk factors. Ask your doctor about immunizations. Certain viruses increase your risk of cancer.

A white, waxy, scar-like lesion without a clearly defined border, called morpheaform basal cell carcinoma, is the least common.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Basal cell carcinoma occurs when one of the skin\\'s basal cells develops a mutation in its DNA. Basal cells are found at the bottom of the epidermis — the outermost layer of skin. Basal cells produce new skin cells. As new skin cells are produced, they push older cells toward the skin\\'s surface, where the old cells die and are sloughed off. The process of creating new skin cells is controlled by a basal cell\\'s DNA. The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutation tells the basal cell to multiply rapidly and continue growing when it would normally die. Eventually the accumulating abnormal cells may form a cancerous tumor — the lesion that appears on the skin. Ultraviolet light and other causes, Much of the damage to DNA in basal cells is thought to result from ultraviolet radiation found in sunlight and in commercial tanning lamps and tanning beds.

Radiation therapy to treat acne or other skin conditions may increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma at previous treatment sites on the skin. Fair skin. The risk of basal cell carcinoma is higher among people who freckle or burn easily or who have very light skin, red or blond hair, or light-colored eyes. Increasing age. Because basal cell carcinoma often takes decades to develop, the majority of basal cell carcinomas occur in older adults. But it can also affect younger adults and is becoming more common in people in their 20s and 30s. A personal or family history of skin cancer. If you\\'ve had basal cell carcinoma one or more times, you have a good chance of developing it again. If you have a family history of skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of developing basal cell carcinoma. Immune-suppressing drugs. Taking medications that suppress your immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs used after transplant surgery, significantly increases your risk of skin cancer. Exposure to arsenic. Arsenic, a toxic metal that\\'s found widely in the environment, increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma and other cancers. Everyone has some arsenic exposure because it occurs naturally. But some people may have higher exposure if they drink contaminated well water or have a job that involves producing or using arsenic. Inherited syndromes that cause skin cancer. Certain rare genetic diseases can increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma, including nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \\'Complications of basal cell carcinoma can include: A risk of recurrence. Basal cell carcinomas commonly recur, even after successful treatment. An increased risk of other types of skin cancer.

Very rarely, basal cell carcinoma can spread to nearby lymph nodes and other areas of the body, such as the bones and lungs.\\', \\'mayo_prevention\\': \"To reduce your risk of basal cell carcinoma you can: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. In many places, the sun\\'s rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even during winter or when the sky is cloudy. Wear sunscreen year-round. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you\\'re swimming or perspiring., Wear protective clothing. Cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or visor. Some companies also sell protective clothing. A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand. Don\\'t forget sunglasses.

They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face. Melanomas can also occur in areas that don\\'t receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole, The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin, Melanoma doesn\\'t always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles, Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They\\'re oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma, To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch . E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas, Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn\\'t think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it\\'s more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It\\'s more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye . An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Melanoma occurs when something goes wrong in the melanin-producing cells that give color to your skin. Normally, skin cells develop in a controlled and orderly way — healthy new cells push older cells toward your skin\\'s surface, where they die and eventually fall off. But when some cells develop DNA damage, new cells may begin to grow out of control and can eventually form a mass of cancerous cells. Just what damages DNA in skin cells and how this leads to melanoma isn\\'t clear. It\\'s likely that a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors, causes melanoma. Still, doctors believe exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds is the leading cause of melanoma. UV light doesn\\'t cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don\\'t receive exposure to sunlight. This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"Factors that may increase your risk of melanoma include: Fair skin. Having less pigment in your skin means you have less protection from damaging UV radiation. If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you\\'re more likely to develop melanoma than is someone with a darker complexion. But melanoma can develop in people with darker complexions, including Hispanic people and black people. A history of sunburn. One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma. Excessive ultraviolet light exposure. Exposure to UV radiation, which comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds, can increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation. People living closer to the earth\\'s equator, where the sun\\'s rays are more direct, experience higher amounts of UV radiation than do those living farther north or south. In addition, if you live at a high elevation, you\\'re exposed to more UV radiation. Having many moles or unusual moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Also, having an unusual type of mole increases the risk of melanoma. Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these tend to be larger than normal moles and have irregular borders and a mixture of colors. A family history of melanoma. If a close relative — such as a parent, child or sibling — has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too. Weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Your immune system may be impaired if you take medicine to suppress the immune system, such as after an organ transplant, or if you have a disease that impairs the immune system, such as AIDS.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. For many people in North America, the sun\\'s rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy. You absorb UV radiation year-round, and clouds offer little protection from damaging rays. Avoiding the sun at its strongest helps you avoid the sunburns and suntans that cause skin damage and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Sun exposure accumulated over time also may cause skin cancer., Wear sunscreen year-round. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days.

The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide. Errors in the instructions can cause the cell to stop its normal function and may allow a cell to become cancerous. What do gene mutations do?, A gene mutation can instruct a healthy cell to: Allow rapid growth. A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly. This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation. Fail to stop uncontrolled cell growth. Normal cells know when to stop growing so that you have just the right number of each type of cell. Cancer cells lose the controls that tell them when to stop growing. A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating. Make mistakes when repairing DNA errors. DNA repair genes look for errors in a cell\\'s DNA and make corrections. A mutation in a DNA repair gene may mean that other errors aren\\'t corrected, leading cells to become cancerous. These mutations are the most common ones found in cancer. But many other gene mutations can contribute to causing cancer. What causes gene mutations?, Gene mutations can occur for several reasons, for instance: Gene mutations you\\'re born with. You may be born with a genetic mutation that you inherited from your parents. This type of mutation accounts for a small percentage of cancers. Gene mutations that occur after birth. Most gene mutations occur after you\\'re born and aren\\'t inherited. A number of forces can cause gene mutations, such as smoking, radiation, viruses, cancer-causing chemicals, obesity, hormones, chronic inflammation and a lack of exercise. Gene mutations occur frequently during normal cell growth. However, cells contain a mechanism that recognizes when a mistake occurs and repairs the mistake. Occasionally, a mistake is missed. This could cause a cell to become cancerous. How do gene mutations interact with each other?, The gene mutations you\\'re born with and those that you acquire throughout your life work together to cause cancer. For instance, if you\\'ve inherited a genetic mutation that predisposes you to cancer, that doesn\\'t mean you\\'re certain to get cancer. Instead, you may need one or more other gene mutations to cause cancer. Your inherited gene mutation could make you more likely than other people to develop cancer when exposed to a certain cancer-causing substance. It\\'s not clear just how many mutations must accumulate for cancer to form. It\\'s likely that this varies among cancer types.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"While doctors have an idea of what may increase your risk of cancer, the majority of cancers occur in people who don\\'t have any known risk factors. Factors known to increase your risk of cancer include: Your age, Cancer can take decades to develop. That\\'s why most people diagnosed with cancer are 65 or older. While it\\'s more common in older adults, cancer isn\\'t exclusively an adult disease — cancer can be diagnosed at any age. Your habits, Certain lifestyle choices are known to increase your risk of cancer. Smoking, drinking more than one alcoholic drink a day or two drinks a day, excessive exposure to the sun or frequent blistering sunburns, being obese, and having unsafe sex can contribute to cancer. You can change these habits to lower your risk of cancer — though some habits are easier to change than others. Your family history, Only a small portion of cancers are due to an inherited condition. If cancer is common in your family, it\\'s possible that mutations are being passed from one generation to the next. You might be a candidate for genetic testing to see whether you have inherited mutations that might increase your risk of certain cancers. Keep in mind that having an inherited genetic mutation doesn\\'t necessarily mean you\\'ll get cancer. Your health conditions, Some chronic health conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, can markedly increase your risk of developing certain cancers. Talk to your doctor about your risk. Your environment, The environment around you may contain harmful chemicals that can increase your risk of cancer. Even if you don\\'t smoke, you might inhale secondhand smoke if you go where people are smoking or if you live with someone who smokes. Chemicals in your home or workplace, such as asbestos and benzene, also are associated with an increased risk of cancer.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"Cancer and its treatment can cause several complications, including: Pain. Pain can be caused by cancer or by cancer treatment, though not all cancer is painful. Medications and other approaches can effectively treat cancer-related pain. Fatigue. Fatigue in people with cancer has many causes, but it can often be managed. Fatigue associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatments is common, but it\\'s usually temporary. Difficulty breathing. Cancer or cancer treatment may cause a feeling of being short of breath. Treatments may bring relief. Nausea. Certain cancers and cancer treatments can cause nausea. Your doctor can sometimes predict if your treatment is likely to cause nausea. Medications and other treatments may help you prevent or decrease nausea. Diarrhea or constipation. Cancer and cancer treatment can affect your bowels and cause diarrhea or constipation. Weight loss. Cancer and cancer treatment may cause weight loss. Cancer steals food from normal cells and deprives them of nutrients. This is often not affected by how many calories or what kind of food is eaten; it\\'s difficult to treat. In most cases, using artificial nutrition through tubes into the stomach or vein does not help change the weight loss. Chemical changes in your body. Cancer can upset the normal chemical balance in your body and increase your risk of serious complications. Signs and symptoms of chemical imbalances might include excessive thirst, frequent urination, constipation and confusion. Brain and nervous system problems. Cancer can press on nearby nerves and cause pain and loss of function of one part of your body. Cancer that involves the brain can cause headaches and stroke-like signs and symptoms, such as weakness on one side of your body. Unusual immune system reactions to cancer. In some cases the body\\'s immune system may react to the presence of cancer by attacking healthy cells. Called paraneoplastic syndrome, these very rare reactions can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, such as difficulty walking and seizures. Cancer that spreads. As cancer advances, it may spread to other parts of the body. Where cancer spreads depends on the type of cancer. Cancer that returns. Cancer survivors have a risk of cancer recurrence. Some cancers are more likely to recur than others. Ask your doctor about what you can do to reduce your risk of cancer recurrence. Your doctor may devise a follow-up care plan for you after treatment. This plan may include periodic scans and exams in the months and years after your treatment, to look for cancer recurrence.\", \\'mayo_prevention\\': \"There\\'s no certain way to prevent cancer. But doctors have identified several ways of reducing your cancer risk, such as: Stop smoking. If you smoke, quit. If you don\\'t smoke, don\\'t start.

Harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun can increase your risk of skin cancer. Limit your sun exposure by staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing or applying sunscreen. Eat a healthy diet. Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Select whole grains and lean proteins. Exercise most days of the week. Regular exercise is linked to a lower risk of cancer. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. If you haven\\'t been exercising regularly, start out slowly and work your way up to 30 minutes or longer. Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or obese may increase your risk of cancer. Work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise.

Morphologically, it is characterized by the presence of strands, cords, and columns of basaloid cells infiltrating the dermis. Perineural invasion may be present and the basaloid cell infiltrate may extend into deeper tissues.\\', \\'mayo_symptoms\\': \"Basal cell carcinoma usually develops on sun-exposed parts of your body, especially your head and neck. Less often, basal cell carcinoma can develop on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the genitals. Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won\\'t heal. These changes in the skin usually have one of the following characteristics: A pearly white, skin-colored or pink bump that is translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface. Tiny blood vessels are often visible. In people with darker skin tones, the lesion may be darker but still somewhat translucent. The most common type of basal cell carcinoma, this lesion often appears on the face and ears. The lesion may rupture, bleed and scab over. A brown, black or blue lesion — or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised, translucent border. A flat, scaly, reddish patch with a raised edge is more common on the back or chest. Over time, these patches can grow quite large. A white, waxy, scar-like lesion without a clearly defined border, called morpheaform basal cell carcinoma, is the least common.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Basal cell carcinoma occurs when one of the skin\\'s basal cells develops a mutation in its DNA. Basal cells are found at the bottom of the epidermis — the outermost layer of skin. Basal cells produce new skin cells. As new skin cells are produced, they push older cells toward the skin\\'s surface, where the old cells die and are sloughed off. The process of creating new skin cells is controlled by a basal cell\\'s DNA. The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutation tells the basal cell to multiply rapidly and continue growing when it would normally die. Eventually the accumulating abnormal cells may form a cancerous tumor — the lesion that appears on the skin. Ultraviolet light and other causes, Much of the damage to DNA in basal cells is thought to result from ultraviolet radiation found in sunlight and in commercial tanning lamps and tanning beds. But sun exposure doesn\\'t explain skin cancers that develop on skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. Other factors can contribute to the risk and development of basal cell carcinoma, and the exact cause may in some cases not be clear.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"Factors that increase your risk of basal cell carcinoma include: Chronic sun exposure. A lot of time spent in the sun — or in commercial tanning beds — increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma. The threat is greater if you live in a sunny or high-altitude location, both of which expose you to more UV radiation. Severe sunburns also increase your risk. Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy to treat acne or other skin conditions may increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma at previous treatment sites on the skin. Fair skin. The risk of basal cell carcinoma is higher among people who freckle or burn easily or who have very light skin, red or blond hair, or light-colored eyes. Increasing age. Because basal cell carcinoma often takes decades to develop, the majority of basal cell carcinomas occur in older adults. But it can also affect younger adults and is becoming more common in people in their 20s and 30s. A personal or family history of skin cancer. If you\\'ve had basal cell carcinoma one or more times, you have a good chance of developing it again. If you have a family history of skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of developing basal cell carcinoma. Immune-suppressing drugs. Taking medications that suppress your immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs used after transplant surgery, significantly increases your risk of skin cancer. Exposure to arsenic. Arsenic, a toxic metal that\\'s found widely in the environment, increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma and other cancers. Everyone has some arsenic exposure because it occurs naturally. But some people may have higher exposure if they drink contaminated well water or have a job that involves producing or using arsenic. Inherited syndromes that cause skin cancer. Certain rare genetic diseases can increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma, including nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \\'Complications of basal cell carcinoma can include: A risk of recurrence. Basal cell carcinomas commonly recur, even after successful treatment. An increased risk of other types of skin cancer. A history of basal cell carcinoma may also increase the chance of developing other types of skin cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer that spreads beyond the skin. Very rarely, basal cell carcinoma can spread to nearby lymph nodes and other areas of the body, such as the bones and lungs.\\', \\'mayo_prevention\\': \"To reduce your risk of basal cell carcinoma you can: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day.

Clinical manifestations vary depending on the site of occurrence.\\', \\'mayo_symptoms\\': \"Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face. Melanomas can also occur in areas that don\\'t receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole, The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin, Melanoma doesn\\'t always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles, Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They\\'re oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma, To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch . E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas, Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn\\'t think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it\\'s more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It\\'s more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye . An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Melanoma occurs when something goes wrong in the melanin-producing cells that give color to your skin. Normally, skin cells develop in a controlled and orderly way — healthy new cells push older cells toward your skin\\'s surface, where they die and eventually fall off. But when some cells develop DNA damage, new cells may begin to grow out of control and can eventually form a mass of cancerous cells. Just what damages DNA in skin cells and how this leads to melanoma isn\\'t clear. It\\'s likely that a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors, causes melanoma. Still, doctors believe exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds is the leading cause of melanoma.

But melanoma can develop in people with darker complexions, including Hispanic people and black people. A history of sunburn. One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma. Excessive ultraviolet light exposure. Exposure to UV radiation, which comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds, can increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation. People living closer to the earth\\'s equator, where the sun\\'s rays are more direct, experience higher amounts of UV radiation than do those living farther north or south. In addition, if you live at a high elevation, you\\'re exposed to more UV radiation. Having many moles or unusual moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Also, having an unusual type of mole increases the risk of melanoma. Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these tend to be larger than normal moles and have irregular borders and a mixture of colors. A family history of melanoma. If a close relative — such as a parent, child or sibling — has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too. Weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Your immune system may be impaired if you take medicine to suppress the immune system, such as after an organ transplant, or if you have a disease that impairs the immune system, such as AIDS.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day.

An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Melanoma occurs when something goes wrong in the melanin-producing cells that give color to your skin. Normally, skin cells develop in a controlled and orderly way — healthy new cells push older cells toward your skin\\'s surface, where they die and eventually fall off. But when some cells develop DNA damage, new cells may begin to grow out of control and can eventually form a mass of cancerous cells. Just what damages DNA in skin cells and how this leads to melanoma isn\\'t clear. It\\'s likely that a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors, causes melanoma. Still, doctors believe exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds is the leading cause of melanoma. UV light doesn\\'t cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don\\'t receive exposure to sunlight. This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"Factors that may increase your risk of melanoma include: Fair skin. Having less pigment in your skin means you have less protection from damaging UV radiation. If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you\\'re more likely to develop melanoma than is someone with a darker complexion. But melanoma can develop in people with darker complexions, including Hispanic people and black people. A history of sunburn. One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma. Excessive ultraviolet light exposure. Exposure to UV radiation, which comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds, can increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation. People living closer to the earth\\'s equator, where the sun\\'s rays are more direct, experience higher amounts of UV radiation than do those living farther north or south. In addition, if you live at a high elevation, you\\'re exposed to more UV radiation. Having many moles or unusual moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Also, having an unusual type of mole increases the risk of melanoma. Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these tend to be larger than normal moles and have irregular borders and a mixture of colors. A family history of melanoma. If a close relative — such as a parent, child or sibling — has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too. Weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Your immune system may be impaired if you take medicine to suppress the immune system, such as after an organ transplant, or if you have a disease that impairs the immune system, such as AIDS.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. For many people in North America, the sun\\'s rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy. You absorb UV radiation year-round, and clouds offer little protection from damaging rays. Avoiding the sun at its strongest helps you avoid the sunburns and suntans that cause skin damage and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Sun exposure accumulated over time also may cause skin cancer., Wear sunscreen year-round. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you\\'re swimming or perspiring., Wear protective clothing. Cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or visor. Some companies also sell protective clothing. A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand. Don\\'t forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of UV radiation — UVA and UVB rays., Avoid tanning lamps and beds. Tanning lamps and beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer., Become familiar with your skin so that you\\'ll notice changes. Examine your skin often for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Examine your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Examine both the front and back of your legs and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes.

Less often, basal cell carcinoma can develop on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the genitals. Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won\\'t heal. These changes in the skin usually have one of the following characteristics: A pearly white, skin-colored or pink bump that is translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface. Tiny blood vessels are often visible. In people with darker skin tones, the lesion may be darker but still somewhat translucent. The most common type of basal cell carcinoma, this lesion often appears on the face and ears. The lesion may rupture, bleed and scab over. A brown, black or blue lesion — or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised, translucent border. A flat, scaly, reddish patch with a raised edge is more common on the back or chest. Over time, these patches can grow quite large. A white, waxy, scar-like lesion without a clearly defined border, called morpheaform basal cell carcinoma, is the least common.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Basal cell carcinoma occurs when one of the skin\\'s basal cells develops a mutation in its DNA. Basal cells are found at the bottom of the epidermis — the outermost layer of skin. Basal cells produce new skin cells. As new skin cells are produced, they push older cells toward the skin\\'s surface, where the old cells die and are sloughed off. The process of creating new skin cells is controlled by a basal cell\\'s DNA. The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutation tells the basal cell to multiply rapidly and continue growing when it would normally die. Eventually the accumulating abnormal cells may form a cancerous tumor — the lesion that appears on the skin. Ultraviolet light and other causes, Much of the damage to DNA in basal cells is thought to result from ultraviolet radiation found in sunlight and in commercial tanning lamps and tanning beds.

Radiation therapy to treat acne or other skin conditions may increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma at previous treatment sites on the skin. Fair skin. The risk of basal cell carcinoma is higher among people who freckle or burn easily or who have very light skin, red or blond hair, or light-colored eyes. Increasing age. Because basal cell carcinoma often takes decades to develop, the majority of basal cell carcinomas occur in older adults. But it can also affect younger adults and is becoming more common in people in their 20s and 30s. A personal or family history of skin cancer. If you\\'ve had basal cell carcinoma one or more times, you have a good chance of developing it again. If you have a family history of skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of developing basal cell carcinoma. Immune-suppressing drugs. Taking medications that suppress your immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs used after transplant surgery, significantly increases your risk of skin cancer. Exposure to arsenic. Arsenic, a toxic metal that\\'s found widely in the environment, increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma and other cancers. Everyone has some arsenic exposure because it occurs naturally. But some people may have higher exposure if they drink contaminated well water or have a job that involves producing or using arsenic. Inherited syndromes that cause skin cancer.

They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face. Melanomas can also occur in areas that don\\'t receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole, The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin, Melanoma doesn\\'t always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles, Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They\\'re oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma, To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch . E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas, Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn\\'t think to check.

Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It\\'s more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina.

Less often, basal cell carcinoma can develop on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the genitals. Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won\\'t heal. These changes in the skin usually have one of the following characteristics: A pearly white, skin-colored or pink bump that is translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface. Tiny blood vessels are often visible. In people with darker skin tones, the lesion may be darker but still somewhat translucent. The most common type of basal cell carcinoma, this lesion often appears on the face and ears. The lesion may rupture, bleed and scab over. A brown, black or blue lesion — or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised, translucent border. A flat, scaly, reddish patch with a raised edge is more common on the back or chest. Over time, these patches can grow quite large.

Basal cells are found at the bottom of the epidermis — the outermost layer of skin. Basal cells produce new skin cells. As new skin cells are produced, they push older cells toward the skin\\'s surface, where the old cells die and are sloughed off. The process of creating new skin cells is controlled by a basal cell\\'s DNA. The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutation tells the basal cell to multiply rapidly and continue growing when it would normally die. Eventually the accumulating abnormal cells may form a cancerous tumor — the lesion that appears on the skin. Ultraviolet light and other causes, Much of the damage to DNA in basal cells is thought to result from ultraviolet radiation found in sunlight and in commercial tanning lamps and tanning beds.

It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles, Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They\\'re oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma, To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch . E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas, Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn\\'t think to check.

Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It\\'s more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye.

Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma, This ABCDE guide can help you determine if a mole or a spot may indicate melanoma or other skin cancers: A is for asymmetrical shape. One half is unlike the other half. B is for border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders. C is for color. Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch . E is for evolving. Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height, especially if part or all of a mole turns black. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the features listed above. Others may have only one or two.\\', \\'mayo_causes\\': \\'Moles are caused when cells in the skin grow in clusters or clumps. Melanocytes are distributed throughout your skin and produce melanin, the natural pigment that gives your skin its color.\\', \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"Melanoma is the main complication of moles. Some people have a higher than average risk of their moles becoming cancerous and developing into melanoma. Factors that increase your risk of melanoma include: Being born with large moles. These types of moles are called congenital nevi. On an infant, such moles are classified as large if they\\'re more than 2 inches in diameter. Even a large mole seldom becomes cancerous and almost never before the child reaches puberty. Having unusual moles. Moles that are bigger than a common mole and irregular in shape are known as atypical nevi. They tend to be hereditary. And they often have dark brown centers and lighter, uneven borders. Having many moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Two studies add to the evidence that the number of your moles predict cancer risk. One showed that people under 50 years old who have 20 or more moles on their arms are at increased risk of melanoma. Another showed a relationship between the number of women\\'s moles and breast cancer risk. Having a personal or family history of melanoma. If you\\'ve had melanoma before, you are at increased risk of a mole becoming cancerous. In addition, some types of atypical moles lead to a genetic form of melanoma.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"The following measures can help limit the development of moles and the main complication of moles — melanoma. Watch for changes, Become familiar with the location and pattern of your moles. Regularly examine your skin to look for changes that may signal melanoma. Do self-exams once a month, especially if you have a family history of melanoma. With the help of mirrors, do a head-to-toe check, including your scalp, palms and fingernails, armpits, chest, legs, and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between the toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors for melanoma and whether you need a professional skin exam on a routine basis. Protect your skin, Take measures to protect your skin from ultraviolet radiation, such as from the sun or tanning beds. UV radiation has been linked to increased melanoma risk. And children who haven\\'t been protected from sun exposure tend to develop more moles. Avoid peak sun times. For many people in North America, the sun\\'s rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even on cloudy days or in winter. Use sunscreen year-round. Apply sunscreen about 30 minutes before going outdoors, even on cloudy days. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Apply it generously and reapply every two hours — or more often if you\\'re swimming or sweating. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. Cover up. Sunglasses, broad-brimmed hats, long sleeves and other protective clothing can help you avoid damaging UV rays. You might also want to consider clothing that\\'s made with fabric specially treated to block UV radiation. Avoid tanning lamps and beds. Tanning lamps and beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer.\", \\'mayo_see_doc\\': \\'When to see a doctor, Make an appointment with your doctor if a mole looks unusual, grows or changes.\\'}}'},\n",

These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole, The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin, Melanoma doesn\\'t always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles, Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They\\'re oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma, To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape.

Hidden melanomas, Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn\\'t think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it\\'s more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It\\'s more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye . An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Melanoma occurs when something goes wrong in the melanin-producing cells that give color to your skin. Normally, skin cells develop in a controlled and orderly way — healthy new cells push older cells toward your skin\\'s surface, where they die and eventually fall off. But when some cells develop DNA damage, new cells may begin to grow out of control and can eventually form a mass of cancerous cells. Just what damages DNA in skin cells and how this leads to melanoma isn\\'t clear. It\\'s likely that a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors, causes melanoma. Still, doctors believe exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds is the leading cause of melanoma. UV light doesn\\'t cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don\\'t receive exposure to sunlight. This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"Factors that may increase your risk of melanoma include: Fair skin. Having less pigment in your skin means you have less protection from damaging UV radiation. If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you\\'re more likely to develop melanoma than is someone with a darker complexion. But melanoma can develop in people with darker complexions, including Hispanic people and black people. A history of sunburn. One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma. Excessive ultraviolet light exposure. Exposure to UV radiation, which comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds, can increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation. People living closer to the earth\\'s equator, where the sun\\'s rays are more direct, experience higher amounts of UV radiation than do those living farther north or south. In addition, if you live at a high elevation, you\\'re exposed to more UV radiation. Having many moles or unusual moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Also, having an unusual type of mole increases the risk of melanoma. Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these tend to be larger than normal moles and have irregular borders and a mixture of colors. A family history of melanoma. If a close relative — such as a parent, child or sibling — has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too. Weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Your immune system may be impaired if you take medicine to suppress the immune system, such as after an organ transplant, or if you have a disease that impairs the immune system, such as AIDS.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day.

The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide. Errors in the instructions can cause the cell to stop its normal function and may allow a cell to become cancerous. What do gene mutations do?, A gene mutation can instruct a healthy cell to: Allow rapid growth. A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly. This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation. Fail to stop uncontrolled cell growth. Normal cells know when to stop growing so that you have just the right number of each type of cell. Cancer cells lose the controls that tell them when to stop growing. A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating. Make mistakes when repairing DNA errors. DNA repair genes look for errors in a cell\\'s DNA and make corrections. A mutation in a DNA repair gene may mean that other errors aren\\'t corrected, leading cells to become cancerous. These mutations are the most common ones found in cancer. But many other gene mutations can contribute to causing cancer. What causes gene mutations?, Gene mutations can occur for several reasons, for instance: Gene mutations you\\'re born with. You may be born with a genetic mutation that you inherited from your parents. This type of mutation accounts for a small percentage of cancers. Gene mutations that occur after birth. Most gene mutations occur after you\\'re born and aren\\'t inherited. A number of forces can cause gene mutations, such as smoking, radiation, viruses, cancer-causing chemicals, obesity, hormones, chronic inflammation and a lack of exercise. Gene mutations occur frequently during normal cell growth. However, cells contain a mechanism that recognizes when a mistake occurs and repairs the mistake. Occasionally, a mistake is missed. This could cause a cell to become cancerous. How do gene mutations interact with each other?, The gene mutations you\\'re born with and those that you acquire throughout your life work together to cause cancer. For instance, if you\\'ve inherited a genetic mutation that predisposes you to cancer, that doesn\\'t mean you\\'re certain to get cancer. Instead, you may need one or more other gene mutations to cause cancer. Your inherited gene mutation could make you more likely than other people to develop cancer when exposed to a certain cancer-causing substance. It\\'s not clear just how many mutations must accumulate for cancer to form. It\\'s likely that this varies among cancer types.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"While doctors have an idea of what may increase your risk of cancer, the majority of cancers occur in people who don\\'t have any known risk factors. Factors known to increase your risk of cancer include: Your age, Cancer can take decades to develop. That\\'s why most people diagnosed with cancer are 65 or older. While it\\'s more common in older adults, cancer isn\\'t exclusively an adult disease — cancer can be diagnosed at any age. Your habits, Certain lifestyle choices are known to increase your risk of cancer. Smoking, drinking more than one alcoholic drink a day or two drinks a day, excessive exposure to the sun or frequent blistering sunburns, being obese, and having unsafe sex can contribute to cancer. You can change these habits to lower your risk of cancer — though some habits are easier to change than others. Your family history, Only a small portion of cancers are due to an inherited condition. If cancer is common in your family, it\\'s possible that mutations are being passed from one generation to the next. You might be a candidate for genetic testing to see whether you have inherited mutations that might increase your risk of certain cancers. Keep in mind that having an inherited genetic mutation doesn\\'t necessarily mean you\\'ll get cancer. Your health conditions, Some chronic health conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, can markedly increase your risk of developing certain cancers. Talk to your doctor about your risk. Your environment, The environment around you may contain harmful chemicals that can increase your risk of cancer. Even if you don\\'t smoke, you might inhale secondhand smoke if you go where people are smoking or if you live with someone who smokes. Chemicals in your home or workplace, such as asbestos and benzene, also are associated with an increased risk of cancer.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"Cancer and its treatment can cause several complications, including: Pain. Pain can be caused by cancer or by cancer treatment, though not all cancer is painful. Medications and other approaches can effectively treat cancer-related pain. Fatigue. Fatigue in people with cancer has many causes, but it can often be managed. Fatigue associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatments is common, but it\\'s usually temporary. Difficulty breathing. Cancer or cancer treatment may cause a feeling of being short of breath. Treatments may bring relief. Nausea. Certain cancers and cancer treatments can cause nausea. Your doctor can sometimes predict if your treatment is likely to cause nausea. Medications and other treatments may help you prevent or decrease nausea. Diarrhea or constipation. Cancer and cancer treatment can affect your bowels and cause diarrhea or constipation. Weight loss. Cancer and cancer treatment may cause weight loss. Cancer steals food from normal cells and deprives them of nutrients. This is often not affected by how many calories or what kind of food is eaten; it\\'s difficult to treat. In most cases, using artificial nutrition through tubes into the stomach or vein does not help change the weight loss. Chemical changes in your body. Cancer can upset the normal chemical balance in your body and increase your risk of serious complications. Signs and symptoms of chemical imbalances might include excessive thirst, frequent urination, constipation and confusion. Brain and nervous system problems. Cancer can press on nearby nerves and cause pain and loss of function of one part of your body. Cancer that involves the brain can cause headaches and stroke-like signs and symptoms, such as weakness on one side of your body. Unusual immune system reactions to cancer. In some cases the body\\'s immune system may react to the presence of cancer by attacking healthy cells. Called paraneoplastic syndrome, these very rare reactions can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, such as difficulty walking and seizures. Cancer that spreads. As cancer advances, it may spread to other parts of the body. Where cancer spreads depends on the type of cancer. Cancer that returns. Cancer survivors have a risk of cancer recurrence. Some cancers are more likely to recur than others. Ask your doctor about what you can do to reduce your risk of cancer recurrence. Your doctor may devise a follow-up care plan for you after treatment. This plan may include periodic scans and exams in the months and years after your treatment, to look for cancer recurrence.\", \\'mayo_prevention\\': \"There\\'s no certain way to prevent cancer. But doctors have identified several ways of reducing your cancer risk, such as: Stop smoking. If you smoke, quit. If you don\\'t smoke, don\\'t start. Smoking is linked to several types of cancer — not just lung cancer. Stopping now will reduce your risk of cancer in the future. Avoid excessive sun exposure. Harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun can increase your risk of skin cancer. Limit your sun exposure by staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing or applying sunscreen. Eat a healthy diet. Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Select whole grains and lean proteins. Exercise most days of the week. Regular exercise is linked to a lower risk of cancer. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. If you haven\\'t been exercising regularly, start out slowly and work your way up to 30 minutes or longer. Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or obese may increase your risk of cancer. Work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise. Drink alcohol in moderation, if you choose to drink. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit yourself to one drink a day if you\\'re a woman of any age or a man older than age 65, or two drinks a day if you\\'re a man 65 years old or younger. Schedule cancer screening exams. Talk to your doctor about what types of cancer screening exams are best for you based on your risk factors. Ask your doctor about immunizations. Certain viruses increase your risk of cancer. Immunizations may help prevent those viruses, including hepatitis B, which increases the risk of liver cancer, and human papillomavirus, which increases the risk of cervical cancer and other cancers. Ask your doctor whether immunization against these viruses is appropriate for you.\", \\'mayo_see_doc\\': \"When to see a doctor, Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that concern you.

C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch . E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas, Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn\\'t think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it\\'s more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It\\'s more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye . An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Melanoma occurs when something goes wrong in the melanin-producing cells that give color to your skin. Normally, skin cells develop in a controlled and orderly way — healthy new cells push older cells toward your skin\\'s surface, where they die and eventually fall off. But when some cells develop DNA damage, new cells may begin to grow out of control and can eventually form a mass of cancerous cells. Just what damages DNA in skin cells and how this leads to melanoma isn\\'t clear. It\\'s likely that a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors, causes melanoma. Still, doctors believe exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds is the leading cause of melanoma. UV light doesn\\'t cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don\\'t receive exposure to sunlight. This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"Factors that may increase your risk of melanoma include: Fair skin. Having less pigment in your skin means you have less protection from damaging UV radiation. If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you\\'re more likely to develop melanoma than is someone with a darker complexion. But melanoma can develop in people with darker complexions, including Hispanic people and black people. A history of sunburn. One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma. Excessive ultraviolet light exposure. Exposure to UV radiation, which comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds, can increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation. People living closer to the earth\\'s equator, where the sun\\'s rays are more direct, experience higher amounts of UV radiation than do those living farther north or south. In addition, if you live at a high elevation, you\\'re exposed to more UV radiation. Having many moles or unusual moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Also, having an unusual type of mole increases the risk of melanoma. Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these tend to be larger than normal moles and have irregular borders and a mixture of colors. A family history of melanoma. If a close relative — such as a parent, child or sibling — has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too. Weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Your immune system may be impaired if you take medicine to suppress the immune system, such as after an organ transplant, or if you have a disease that impairs the immune system, such as AIDS.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. For many people in North America, the sun\\'s rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy. You absorb UV radiation year-round, and clouds offer little protection from damaging rays. Avoiding the sun at its strongest helps you avoid the sunburns and suntans that cause skin damage and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Sun exposure accumulated over time also may cause skin cancer., Wear sunscreen year-round. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you\\'re swimming or perspiring., Wear protective clothing. Cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or visor. Some companies also sell protective clothing. A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand. Don\\'t forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of UV radiation — UVA and UVB rays., Avoid tanning lamps and beds. Tanning lamps and beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer., Become familiar with your skin so that you\\'ll notice changes. Examine your skin often for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Examine your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Examine both the front and back of your legs and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks.\", \\'mayo_see_doc\\': \\'When to see a doctor, Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any skin changes that seem unusual.\\'}}'},\n",

The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide. Errors in the instructions can cause the cell to stop its normal function and may allow a cell to become cancerous. What do gene mutations do?, A gene mutation can instruct a healthy cell to: Allow rapid growth. A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly. This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation. Fail to stop uncontrolled cell growth. Normal cells know when to stop growing so that you have just the right number of each type of cell. Cancer cells lose the controls that tell them when to stop growing. A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating. Make mistakes when repairing DNA errors. DNA repair genes look for errors in a cell\\'s DNA and make corrections. A mutation in a DNA repair gene may mean that other errors aren\\'t corrected, leading cells to become cancerous. These mutations are the most common ones found in cancer. But many other gene mutations can contribute to causing cancer. What causes gene mutations?, Gene mutations can occur for several reasons, for instance: Gene mutations you\\'re born with. You may be born with a genetic mutation that you inherited from your parents. This type of mutation accounts for a small percentage of cancers. Gene mutations that occur after birth. Most gene mutations occur after you\\'re born and aren\\'t inherited. A number of forces can cause gene mutations, such as smoking, radiation, viruses, cancer-causing chemicals, obesity, hormones, chronic inflammation and a lack of exercise. Gene mutations occur frequently during normal cell growth. However, cells contain a mechanism that recognizes when a mistake occurs and repairs the mistake. Occasionally, a mistake is missed. This could cause a cell to become cancerous. How do gene mutations interact with each other?, The gene mutations you\\'re born with and those that you acquire throughout your life work together to cause cancer. For instance, if you\\'ve inherited a genetic mutation that predisposes you to cancer, that doesn\\'t mean you\\'re certain to get cancer. Instead, you may need one or more other gene mutations to cause cancer. Your inherited gene mutation could make you more likely than other people to develop cancer when exposed to a certain cancer-causing substance. It\\'s not clear just how many mutations must accumulate for cancer to form. It\\'s likely that this varies among cancer types.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"While doctors have an idea of what may increase your risk of cancer, the majority of cancers occur in people who don\\'t have any known risk factors. Factors known to increase your risk of cancer include: Your age, Cancer can take decades to develop. That\\'s why most people diagnosed with cancer are 65 or older. While it\\'s more common in older adults, cancer isn\\'t exclusively an adult disease — cancer can be diagnosed at any age. Your habits, Certain lifestyle choices are known to increase your risk of cancer. Smoking, drinking more than one alcoholic drink a day or two drinks a day, excessive exposure to the sun or frequent blistering sunburns, being obese, and having unsafe sex can contribute to cancer. You can change these habits to lower your risk of cancer — though some habits are easier to change than others. Your family history, Only a small portion of cancers are due to an inherited condition. If cancer is common in your family, it\\'s possible that mutations are being passed from one generation to the next. You might be a candidate for genetic testing to see whether you have inherited mutations that might increase your risk of certain cancers. Keep in mind that having an inherited genetic mutation doesn\\'t necessarily mean you\\'ll get cancer. Your health conditions, Some chronic health conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, can markedly increase your risk of developing certain cancers. Talk to your doctor about your risk. Your environment, The environment around you may contain harmful chemicals that can increase your risk of cancer. Even if you don\\'t smoke, you might inhale secondhand smoke if you go where people are smoking or if you live with someone who smokes. Chemicals in your home or workplace, such as asbestos and benzene, also are associated with an increased risk of cancer.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"Cancer and its treatment can cause several complications, including: Pain. Pain can be caused by cancer or by cancer treatment, though not all cancer is painful. Medications and other approaches can effectively treat cancer-related pain. Fatigue. Fatigue in people with cancer has many causes, but it can often be managed. Fatigue associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatments is common, but it\\'s usually temporary. Difficulty breathing. Cancer or cancer treatment may cause a feeling of being short of breath. Treatments may bring relief. Nausea. Certain cancers and cancer treatments can cause nausea. Your doctor can sometimes predict if your treatment is likely to cause nausea. Medications and other treatments may help you prevent or decrease nausea. Diarrhea or constipation. Cancer and cancer treatment can affect your bowels and cause diarrhea or constipation. Weight loss. Cancer and cancer treatment may cause weight loss. Cancer steals food from normal cells and deprives them of nutrients. This is often not affected by how many calories or what kind of food is eaten; it\\'s difficult to treat. In most cases, using artificial nutrition through tubes into the stomach or vein does not help change the weight loss. Chemical changes in your body. Cancer can upset the normal chemical balance in your body and increase your risk of serious complications. Signs and symptoms of chemical imbalances might include excessive thirst, frequent urination, constipation and confusion. Brain and nervous system problems. Cancer can press on nearby nerves and cause pain and loss of function of one part of your body. Cancer that involves the brain can cause headaches and stroke-like signs and symptoms, such as weakness on one side of your body. Unusual immune system reactions to cancer. In some cases the body\\'s immune system may react to the presence of cancer by attacking healthy cells. Called paraneoplastic syndrome, these very rare reactions can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, such as difficulty walking and seizures. Cancer that spreads. As cancer advances, it may spread to other parts of the body. Where cancer spreads depends on the type of cancer. Cancer that returns. Cancer survivors have a risk of cancer recurrence. Some cancers are more likely to recur than others. Ask your doctor about what you can do to reduce your risk of cancer recurrence. Your doctor may devise a follow-up care plan for you after treatment. This plan may include periodic scans and exams in the months and years after your treatment, to look for cancer recurrence.\", \\'mayo_prevention\\': \"There\\'s no certain way to prevent cancer. But doctors have identified several ways of reducing your cancer risk, such as: Stop smoking. If you smoke, quit. If you don\\'t smoke, don\\'t start. Smoking is linked to several types of cancer — not just lung cancer. Stopping now will reduce your risk of cancer in the future. Avoid excessive sun exposure. Harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun can increase your risk of skin cancer. Limit your sun exposure by staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing or applying sunscreen. Eat a healthy diet. Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Select whole grains and lean proteins. Exercise most days of the week. Regular exercise is linked to a lower risk of cancer. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. If you haven\\'t been exercising regularly, start out slowly and work your way up to 30 minutes or longer. Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or obese may increase your risk of cancer. Work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise. Drink alcohol in moderation, if you choose to drink. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit yourself to one drink a day if you\\'re a woman of any age or a man older than age 65, or two drinks a day if you\\'re a man 65 years old or younger. Schedule cancer screening exams. Talk to your doctor about what types of cancer screening exams are best for you based on your risk factors. Ask your doctor about immunizations.

The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole, The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin, Melanoma doesn\\'t always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles, Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They\\'re oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40.

These changes in the skin usually have one of the following characteristics: A pearly white, skin-colored or pink bump that is translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface. Tiny blood vessels are often visible. In people with darker skin tones, the lesion may be darker but still somewhat translucent. The most common type of basal cell carcinoma, this lesion often appears on the face and ears. The lesion may rupture, bleed and scab over. A brown, black or blue lesion — or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised, translucent border. A flat, scaly, reddish patch with a raised edge is more common on the back or chest. Over time, these patches can grow quite large. A white, waxy, scar-like lesion without a clearly defined border, called morpheaform basal cell carcinoma, is the least common.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Basal cell carcinoma occurs when one of the skin\\'s basal cells develops a mutation in its DNA. Basal cells are found at the bottom of the epidermis — the outermost layer of skin. Basal cells produce new skin cells. As new skin cells are produced, they push older cells toward the skin\\'s surface, where the old cells die and are sloughed off. The process of creating new skin cells is controlled by a basal cell\\'s DNA. The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutation tells the basal cell to multiply rapidly and continue growing when it would normally die. Eventually the accumulating abnormal cells may form a cancerous tumor — the lesion that appears on the skin. Ultraviolet light and other causes, Much of the damage to DNA in basal cells is thought to result from ultraviolet radiation found in sunlight and in commercial tanning lamps and tanning beds. But sun exposure doesn\\'t explain skin cancers that develop on skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. Other factors can contribute to the risk and development of basal cell carcinoma, and the exact cause may in some cases not be clear.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"Factors that increase your risk of basal cell carcinoma include: Chronic sun exposure. A lot of time spent in the sun — or in commercial tanning beds — increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma. The threat is greater if you live in a sunny or high-altitude location, both of which expose you to more UV radiation. Severe sunburns also increase your risk. Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy to treat acne or other skin conditions may increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma at previous treatment sites on the skin. Fair skin. The risk of basal cell carcinoma is higher among people who freckle or burn easily or who have very light skin, red or blond hair, or light-colored eyes. Increasing age. Because basal cell carcinoma often takes decades to develop, the majority of basal cell carcinomas occur in older adults. But it can also affect younger adults and is becoming more common in people in their 20s and 30s. A personal or family history of skin cancer. If you\\'ve had basal cell carcinoma one or more times, you have a good chance of developing it again. If you have a family history of skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of developing basal cell carcinoma. Immune-suppressing drugs. Taking medications that suppress your immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs used after transplant surgery, significantly increases your risk of skin cancer. Exposure to arsenic. Arsenic, a toxic metal that\\'s found widely in the environment, increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma and other cancers. Everyone has some arsenic exposure because it occurs naturally. But some people may have higher exposure if they drink contaminated well water or have a job that involves producing or using arsenic. Inherited syndromes that cause skin cancer. Certain rare genetic diseases can increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma, including nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \\'Complications of basal cell carcinoma can include: A risk of recurrence. Basal cell carcinomas commonly recur, even after successful treatment. An increased risk of other types of skin cancer. A history of basal cell carcinoma may also increase the chance of developing other types of skin cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer that spreads beyond the skin. Very rarely, basal cell carcinoma can spread to nearby lymph nodes and other areas of the body, such as the bones and lungs.\\', \\'mayo_prevention\\': \"To reduce your risk of basal cell carcinoma you can: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. In many places, the sun\\'s rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even during winter or when the sky is cloudy. Wear sunscreen year-round. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you\\'re swimming or perspiring., Wear protective clothing. Cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or visor. Some companies also sell protective clothing. A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand. Don\\'t forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of UV radiation — UVA and UVB rays., Avoid tanning beds. Tanning beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer., Check your skin regularly and report changes to your doctor. Examine your skin often for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Examine your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Examine both the front and the back of your legs and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks.\", \\'mayo_see_doc\\': \\'When to see a doctor, Make an appointment with your doctor if you observe changes in the appearance of your skin, such as a new growth, a change in a previous growth or a recurring sore.\\'}}'},\n",

Risk factors include extensive sun exposure during childhood, a family history of melanoma, and the presence of dysplastic nevi.\\', \\'mayo_symptoms\\': \"Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face. Melanomas can also occur in areas that don\\'t receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole, The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin, Melanoma doesn\\'t always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles, Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They\\'re oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma, To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch . E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas, Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn\\'t think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it\\'s more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It\\'s more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye . An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.\", \\'mayo_causes\\': \"Melanoma occurs when something goes wrong in the melanin-producing cells that give color to your skin. Normally, skin cells develop in a controlled and orderly way — healthy new cells push older cells toward your skin\\'s surface, where they die and eventually fall off. But when some cells develop DNA damage, new cells may begin to grow out of control and can eventually form a mass of cancerous cells. Just what damages DNA in skin cells and how this leads to melanoma isn\\'t clear. It\\'s likely that a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors, causes melanoma. Still, doctors believe exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds is the leading cause of melanoma. UV light doesn\\'t cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don\\'t receive exposure to sunlight. This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma.\", \\'mayo_risk_factors\\': \"Factors that may increase your risk of melanoma include: Fair skin. Having less pigment in your skin means you have less protection from damaging UV radiation. If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you\\'re more likely to develop melanoma than is someone with a darker complexion. But melanoma can develop in people with darker complexions, including Hispanic people and black people. A history of sunburn. One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma. Excessive ultraviolet light exposure. Exposure to UV radiation, which comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds, can increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation. People living closer to the earth\\'s equator, where the sun\\'s rays are more direct, experience higher amounts of UV radiation than do those living farther north or south. In addition, if you live at a high elevation, you\\'re exposed to more UV radiation. Having many moles or unusual moles. Having more than 50 ordinary moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. Also, having an unusual type of mole increases the risk of melanoma. Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these tend to be larger than normal moles and have irregular borders and a mixture of colors. A family history of melanoma. If a close relative — such as a parent, child or sibling — has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too. Weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Your immune system may be impaired if you take medicine to suppress the immune system, such as after an organ transplant, or if you have a disease that impairs the immune system, such as AIDS.\", \\'mayo_complications\\': \"You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day.
